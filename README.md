# WeatherAPI

Developed a Weather Web App using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.js. MongoDB was also used to demonstrate how we can save API data to the database collection.
The Web app is fully responsive on different devices, and provides a search engine for users to search for a city temperature and its weather description.
